  |   Despite releasing over a year ago, A Robot Named Fight is still       |
  |   getting new content. Another update due out this week will add new    |
  |   items and synergies, improved map generation, and new content for     |
  |   existing areas.                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Here's the full rundown:                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * New Area, Bosses, and Enemies.                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Explore the brand new Coolant Sewers - an alternate area featuring    |
  |   two new bosses, six new enemy types, 83 new rooms, and new music.     |
  |   Learn to navigate new hazards, including ice, water, and fans.        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * New Items, Synergies, and Achievements.                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   There are 12 new items to snag, including Dive Shell, a powerful      |
  |   new body that allows you to move freely in water and perform a        |
  |   powerful dive kick. Unlock new achievements to discover items like    |
  |   Up Dog, a helpful, robotic, canine sidekick. Old favorites also       |
  |   offer new synergies, such as Energy Axe which can now be made         |
  |   "quite large" by the acquisition of Big Bolts.                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Revised Map Generation.                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   One of the largest changes is a completely overhauled and improved    |
  |   layout generation. Maps now feature more interconnectivity and less   |
  |   predictable placement of special rooms (such as save rooms,           |
  |   teleporters, and shops). The addition of two new layout patterns      |
  |   add even more variety. Finally, The Guts of the Beast have been       |
  |   expanded with more rooms, more danger, and new surprises.             |
  |                                                                         |
